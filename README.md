##  Project Overview
Working with the Disaster Reporting Network to create data visualizations for earthquakes around the world. Basil and Sadhana head the disaster response team and would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
