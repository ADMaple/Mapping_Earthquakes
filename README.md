# Mapping_Earthquakes

##  Project Overview
Working with the Disaster Reporting Network to create data visualizations for earthquakes around the world. Basil and Sadhana head the disaster response team and would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

  -Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
  
  -Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
  
  -Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
  
## Resources
Data Source: tectonic_plate_starter_logic.js and major_eq_starter_logic.js

Software: Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, JSON, Leaflet and HTML

## Analysis and Results of Data

To complete this project, I used GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website, by retrieving geographical coordinates and earthquake magnitudes and adding the data to a map.

I used JavaScript and the D3.js library to pull the coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes from the GeoJSON data and the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request. I also created interactivity for the earthquake data via map legends.
